Imbalanced Data Tutorial
-----------------------

Use 4 different techniques for analyzing imbalanced data. For a classification problem, a dataset is imbalanced if certain levels of the target variable are more frequent than others. Imbalanced data are common, with examples including disease diagnosis, natural disasters, fraud detection, customer churn, and insurance policies. This tutorial provides an overview of the challenges unique to analyzing imbalanced data, how to assess model performance when data are imbalanced, and how to select and implement widely-used techniques for analyzing imbalanced data.

You can see the tutorial itself <a href=https://mitcheljamesdaniel.github.io/projects/Imbalanced_Learning_Tutorial/index.html> here </a>.

Below are the instructions for running the underlying R code.

Instructions
-----------------------

* Clone this repo to your computer
* Open the R project, Imbalanced_Data.Rproj
* Inside the R project, open Imbalanced_data_tutorial.Rmd
* Use renv to recreate the project's environment:
    * renv will automatically bootstrap itself when you open the project
    * you can use renv::status() to see what packages (and versions) must be installed for the code to run
    * use renv::restore() to automate installation of these packages
* Run the script
